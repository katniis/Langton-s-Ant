# Langton's Ant Simulation

## Overview

This project is a Python simulation of **Langton's Ant**, a simple two-dimensional Turing machine invented by Chris Langton in 1986. The simulation visualizes an ant moving on a grid of black and white cells following simple rules that create surprisingly complex behavior.

## How It Works

- The ant moves on a grid where each cell is either black or white.
- **Rules:**
  1. At a **white** cell, the ant turns **right**, flips the cell to black, and moves forward.
  2. At a **black** cell, the ant turns **left**, flips the cell to white, and moves forward.
- Over time, this simple system can create intricate and emergent patterns, including a repeating "highway."
